To install elephant simply type

$ make ; make install

this will compile the external tools wapiti and elman and copy the
executables files in /usr/local/bin . To change the destination directory
the variable PREFIX in the Makefile has to be edited.

After installation, elephant is invoked like in these examples:

(PTB-style output)
$ echo 'Good morning Mr. President.' | elephant -m models/english

(IOB output format)
$ echo 'Good morning Mr. President.' | elephant -m models/english -f iob

It is also possible to run elephant from the source directory without need
to install it, by just typing

$ make

and invoking the executable from the current directory, e.g.

$ echo 'Good morning Mr. President.' | ./elephant -m models/english/

Included in the distribution there are the models for sentence and word boundary
detection of English, Dutch and Italian.
